Mini Mobile Device Lab
======================

There is a real problem testing web pages across multiple devices and the multiple browsers on those 
devices (normally it is a case of manually going to each device and either entering a url or finding 
the synced tab).

This project is a Virtual Device Lab.  It allows you to quickly launch url's across all of a 
developers configured devices in an instant (you can even choose to launch chrome beta, 
opera, android browser etc).
