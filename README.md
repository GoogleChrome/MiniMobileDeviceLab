MiniMobileDeviceLab
===================

IN PROGRESS

Goal of the project:
To enable website developers to test their websites on several devices with one click.
Mobile devices can be any device with a browser (desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet etc).


This project consists of 2 elements:
- an Android app, in the folder MiniMobileDeviceLabAndroid. 
- a Google App Engine app, written in Java, in the folder MiniMobileDeviceLabAppEngine


Android App:
The Android app itself is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cogitas.devicelab.
It is currently in Alpha, being tested by the G+ community https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117991325342063177763

App Engine:
Create an app engine project and deploy the app engine app to it
(TODO: config details to follow)

Android devices:
Install the Android app
Enter the project id and number onto the device
You can close the app if required

Other devices (TODO):
Go to https://your-app-id.appspot.com/listen.html
Login with G+ and enter the name you want to use for this device
You must stay on this page during your testing session
For Safari, make sure you allow pop ups.

Your device lab:
Go to https://your-app-id.appspot.com
Login with G+
You should see a list of your Android and non Android devices (TODO)
For Android devices, you can select which browser to use (if the browser isn't installed on your device, it will open the play store for it)
Enter your url at the top and push the "Send" icon
Go to your devices - your url should have been launched!
